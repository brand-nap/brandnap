Personal Website

Welcome to the cacophony behind the symphony!

If you're reading this, I hope you gain valuable insights and/or takeaways from my code. Whether you came to evaluate my skill, decipher my work, or expand your own repertoire, this website should at worst show you what not to do haha.

Also please feel free to reach out with any thoughts/opinions! I'm still very much growing and receptive to all criticisms

Until next time! -B
